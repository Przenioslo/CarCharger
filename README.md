# CarCharger

The device consists of a buck converter allowing to reduce the input 12 - 40 V to a 5 V (3 A max) output. The output USB A connector's D+/D- lines are configured for 2.1 A output current. After the input voltage drops bellow 12 V, the output voltage is shutdown. It is turned ON again after input voltage rises above 13 V level.
